                    <p id="section-description">I'd like to share some very powerful and revelating recources
                      I've accumulated on health and the effects of thought on the body.
                      Each of these messages from these sources you'll find to be unpopular in the media
                      today. The politicians and news journalists around the
                      world are consistently warning us that we are in danger and face a deadly virus
                      called Covid-19. We are told to be afraid, forced to isolate, distance ourselves from
                      our friends and family members. A hug or even a handshake from someone outside of your
                      "bubble" is considered no longer safe. We are told to mask our faces (our identity,
                      our emotions) when entering an essential store/business.
                      We've been forced to close our "non-essential" businesses (for many of us, our
                      primary source of income) until we "flatten the curve." Our sporting factilities and
                      our local gyms (the places most of us use to exercise - strengthen our body's
                      immune system, engage with like-minded individuals, relieve stress) have been forcibly
                      closed as well. In some countries, a curfew has also been enforced.
                      We're alone and locked up in our own homes as if we were all put on house arrest for
                      someone elses crime. Is there still such a thing as a free country?</p>
                      <p>
                      Well, I'd like to share a few encouraging things here despite what's going on
                      around the world. I'd
                      like to encourage you
                      not to fear and not to lose hope. Do not be dismayed by the message of the media and the
                      fear headlines we are being bombarded with. I have strong reason to believe that this virus is
                      not as bad as they say it is, and without a doubt not as bad as many of us may <i>think</i> it is.
                      I hope this message/perspective I bring can
                      encourage you and that the resources here can help you understand that fear and worry,
                      are not healthy
                      for you and certainly not helpful in any way. Let's open our minds to positivity and
                      hopefulness so we can get through this troubling time.

                              The body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind, whether
                              they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed. At the bidding of unlawful
                              thoughts the body sinks rapidly into disease and decay; at the command of glad and
                              beautiful thoughts it becomes clothed with youthfulness and beauty.
                            </p>

                              <p>
                                Disease and health, like circumstances, are rooted in thought. Sickly thoughts
                                will express themselves through a sickly body. Thoughts of fear have been known
                                to kill a man as speedily as a bullet, and they are continually killing thousands
                                of people just as surely though less rapidly. The people who live in fear of
                                disease are the people who get it. Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole body,
                                and lays it open to the entrance of disease; while impure thoughts, even if not
                                physically indulged, will soon shatter the nervous system.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Strong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in vigor and grace. The body
                                is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds readily to the thoughts by
                                which it is impressed, and habits of thought will produce their own effects, good
                                or bad, upon it.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Men will continue to have impure and poisoned blood so long as they propagate
                                unclean thoughts. Out of a clean heart comes a clean life and a clean body. Out
                                of a defiled mind proceeds a defiled life and corrupt body. Thought is the fount
                                of action, life and manifestation; make the fountain pure, and all will be pure.
                                Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man
                                makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                If you would perfect your body, guard your mind. If you would renew your body,
                                beautify your mind. Thoughts of malice, envy, disappointment, despondency, rob
                                the body of its health and grace. A sour face does not come by chance; it is
                                made by sour thoughts.
                              </p>

                                middle age whose face is drawn into inharmonious contours. The one is the result
                                of a sweet and sunny disposition; the other is the outcome of passion and
                                discontent. As you cannot have a sweet and wholesome abode unless you admit
                                the air and sunshine freely into your rooms, so a strong body and a bright,
                                happy, or serene countenance can only result from the free admittance into the
                                mind of thoughts of joy and good will and serenity. On the faces of the aged
                                there are wrinkles made by sympathy; others by strong and pure thoughts; and
                                others are carved by passion: who cannot distinguish them? With those who have
                                lived righteously, age is calm, peaceful, and softly mellowed, like the
                                setting sun. I have recently seen a philosopher on his deathbed. He was not
                                old except in years. He died as sweetly and peacefully as he had lived. There
                                is no physician like cheerful thought for dissipating the ills of the body;
                                there is no comforter to compare with goodwill for dispersing the shadows of
                                grief and sorrow. To live continually in thoughts of ill-will, cynicism,
                                suspicion, and envy, is to be confined in a self-made prison-hole. But to
                                think well of all, to be cheerful with all, and to patiently learn to find
                                the good in all - such unselfish thoughts are the very portals of heaven;
                                and to dwell day by day in thoughts of peace toward every creature will bring
                                abounding peace to their possessor.

                              This fear may be traced to both physical and social heredity. It is closely
                              associated, as to its origin, with the causes of fear of Old Age and the
                              fear of Death, because it leads one closely to the border of "terrible worlds"
                              of which man knows not, but concerning which he has been taught some
                              discomforting stories. The opinion is somewhat general, also, that certain
                              unethical people engaged in the business of "selling health" have had not a
                              little to do with keeping alive the fear of ill health.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              In the main, man fears ill health because of the terrible pictures which
                              have been planted in his mind of what may happen if death should overtake
                              him. He also fears it because of the economic toll which it may claim.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              A reputable physician estimated that 75% of all people who visit physicians
                              for professional service are suffering with hypochondria (imaginary illness).
                              It has been shown most convincingly that the fear of disease, even where there
                              is not the slightest cause for fear, often produces the physical symptoms of
                              the disease feared.

                              Powerful and mighty is the human mind! It builds or it destroys.
                              Playing upon this common weakness of fear of ill health, dispensers of patent medicines
                              have reaped fortunes. This form of imposition upon credulous humanity became so prevalent
                              some twenty years ago that Colliers' Weekly Magazine conducted a bitter campaign against
                              some of the worst offenders in the patent medicine business.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              During the "flu" epidemic which broke out during the world war, the mayor of New York
                              City took drastic steps to check the damage which people were doing themselves through
                              their inherent fear of ill health. He called in the newspaper men and said to them,
                              "Gentlemen, I feel it necessary to ask you not to publish any scare headlines
                              concerning the 'flu' epidemic. Unless you cooperate with me, we will have a situation
                              which we cannot control." The newspapers quit publishing stories about the "flu,"
                              and within one month the epidemic had been successfully checked.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Through a series of experiments conducted some years ago, it was proved that people
                              may be made ill by suggestion. We conducted this experiment by causing three
                              acquaintances to visit the "victims," each of whom asked the question, "What ails
                              you? You look terribly ill." The first questioner usually provoked a grin, and a
                              nonchalant "Oh, nothing, I'm alright," from the victim. The second questioner
                              usually was answered with the statement, "I don't know exactly, but I do feel
                              badly." The third questioner was usually met with the frank admission that the
                              victim was actually feeling ill.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Try this on an acquaintance if you doubt that it will make him uncomfortable,
                              but do not carry the experiment too far. There is a certain religious sect
                              whose members take vengeance upon their enemies by the "hexing" method. They
                              call it "placing a spell" on the victim.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              There is overwhelming evidence that disease sometimes begins in the form of
                              negative thought impulse. Such an impulse may be passed from one mind to another,
                              by suggestion, or created by an individual in his own mind.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              A man who was blessed with more wisdom than this incident might indicate, once
                              said "When anyone asks me how I feel, I always want to answer by knocking him down."
                            </p>

                              Doctors send patients into new climates for their health, because a change of
                              "mental attitude" is necessary. The seed of fear of ill health lives in every
                              human mind. Worry, fear, discouragement, disappointment in love and business
                              affairs, cause this seed to germinate and grow. The recent business depression
                              kept the doctors on the run, because every form of negative thinking may cause
                              ill health...

                              ...HYPOCHONDRIA. The habit of talking of illness, concentrating the mind upon
                              disease, and expecting its appearance until a nervous break occurs. Nothing
                              that comes in bottles can cure this condition. It is brought on by negative
                              thinking and nothing but positive thought can affect a cure. Hypochondria,
                              (a medical term for imaginary disease) is said to do as much damage on
                              occasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most so-called cases of "nerves"
                              come from imaginary illness...

                              ...SUSCEPTIBILITY. Fear of ill health breaks down Nature's body resistance,
                              and creates a favorable condition for any form of disease one may contact...

                              being stricken by it. The habit of reading patent medicine advertisements...

                              If we're looking for wisdom and truth, it's always a good idea to consider The Bible.
                              I've decided to not go into too much depth here as I'm not a theologian nor a philosopher.

                              final thing. Fix your thoughts
                              on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think
                              about things that are excellent and worthy of praise." (NLT)

                            and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled

                            <span class="font-weight-bolder">Jeremiah 29:11</span> "'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the
                            Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a
                            future.'" (NIV)

                            <span class="font-weight-bolder">Romans 8:28–31</span> "And we know that in all things God works for the good
                            of those who love him, who have been called according to His purpose. For those God
                            foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might
                            be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also
                            called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
                            What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be
                            against us?" (NIV)

                            for those who trust in him." (NIV)
