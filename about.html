                If you're unfamiliar with the term 'Front End' it
                basically just means the visual aesthetics, content, layout, animations etc
                that we see. Back end would be database management, payment transactions
                etc, all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes that most third party services
                would offer because of its complexity and cost to manage.

                If you're unfamiliar with the term 'Responsive' it
                means that the website is designed to look beautiful, presentable and readible on ALL
                screen sizes (ie desktop computer screens as well as iPads/Tablets as well as mobile phones).

              If you have
              services and/or products that people need, you want them to be able to understand why they
              need your product/service. And for you to have that opportunity to educate people on why
              they need what you're selling, it's important for you to have their undivided attention.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              When people arrive at your website, you want them to be captivated enough to stick around to
              hear what you have to say on why they need what you've got for them. So, it is highly recommended
              that you invest in a quality website and this is just the place to receive the quality website your
              business needs.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Typically, you (the customer) will have a look through the free webpage templates on display.
            You (the customer) will then decide upon either:
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>(a) A template you (the customer) like.</li>
              <li>(b) A base template you (the customer) like but with sections, animations/effects from
              other displayed templates you might like.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You (the customer) will request a free quote according to the scale/size of your website, eg.
            3 web pages. Home page (5 sections). About page (2 sections). Blog page (4 sections).</li>
          <li>The quote will be sent to you and will be valid for 7 days.</li>
          <li>If you (the customer) are happy to proceed, you (the customer) will need to login to your
          Fiver, PeoplePerHour or Upwork account (or register for one if you do not have an account
          already). Then create a proposal/job and share the proposal link with Josh. All the specifics and
          nitty gritty can then be discussed from there if/when necessary. Updates, changes, recommendations,
          transfer of work and money between you (the customer) and Joshua (the developer) will all
          be managed by the secure freelancing platform - this insures & protects you from Joshua
          and Joshua from you. Making it a safe and secure business transaction.</li>
        </ul> -->

      <!-- <h1>How long does it usually take to complete this type of work?</h1>
      <p>It usually depends on the size of the project and the level of detail, animations, effects,
        styles, professionalism. A simple single page website could take a couple days to do If it's a large
      sized website it could even take a few weeks as Joshua is currently working as a sole trader.</p> -->
